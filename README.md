**Departures Board Web Installer**

This is the web installer for the Departures Board open source project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/gadec-uk/departures-board). Uses the brilliant open source [ESP Web Tools](https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/) to perform the firmware installation straight from a web browser.
